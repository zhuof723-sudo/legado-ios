/// Legado's `BSAnalyzeUrl` treats the `,{json}` suffix on any rule URL as *URL options*, and one of
/// those options is `js`, **whose return value replaces the URL**
/// (`option.getJs()?.let { url = evalJS(it, url).toString() }`). Sources exploit this to ship an
/// image whose bytes are generated on the device instead of downloaded. 同人小说网's 段評 bubbles
/// are exactly that:
///
/// ```html
/// <img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,,{"style":"TEXT","type":"qdzw",
///      "click":"createSvg(bid,cid,pid,count,nano)","js":"createSvg(bid,cid,pid,count,nano)"}">
/// ```
///
/// The base64 payload is **deliberately empty** — `createSvg()` in the source's jsLib builds the
/// count bubble and returns `data:image/svg+xml;base64,<real payload>`. Our chapter sanitizer
/// strips the `,{json}` suffix (it has to: its inner quotes break SwiftSoup's attribute parsing),
/// which threw the `js` away with it, so all 67 bubbles in a chapter resolved to an empty data URI:
/// nothing drawn, but every `<img>` still claimed a line box — the "段評開了之後排版全亂" report.
///
/// Resolution happens **at chapter-fetch time, in the session that just parsed the content**, not
/// lazily at image-load time, and that timing is load-bearing: `createSvg()` double-duties as the
/// tap handler and decides which job it is by a memory flag its own `getComments()` set moments
/// earlier. Called later (from a disk-cached chapter, say) the flag would be gone and every bubble
/// would try to *open the review page* instead of drawing itself.
