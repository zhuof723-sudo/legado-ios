/// One reusable parsing session per book source (Legado-style lifecycle).
///
/// For a source whose rules contain JS, the expensive part of a parse is not rule
/// extraction — it's standing up the runtime: a fresh JSContext, a dozen shim
/// scripts, and (worst) evaluating the source's `jsLib`. The old pipeline built a
/// new bridge for EVERY call, so one 詳情頁 visit paid it for the info parse,
/// the TOC parse, and again for every additional TOC page; every chapter fetch
/// paid it once more. A session keeps ONE bridge per source and shares it
/// across detail → TOC → next pages → chapters.
///
/// The bridge itself now defers that runtime until a rule actually evaluates JS
/// (`ModernParserBridge.jsEngine`), so a pure CSS/XPath source costs nothing here.
///
/// Concurrency: parse calls mutate bridge-level context (book/chapter bridges,
/// runtime variables) before evaluating, so `withBridge` serializes callers
/// with a lock — same-source parses queue briefly, different sources never
/// block each other. Async operations (network `fetch`, runtime search) use
/// `bridgeForAsyncOperations` without the lock, relying on the JS engine's own
/// serial queue exactly as separate bridges did before.
///
/// Staleness: the cache key includes the source's `lastUpdateTime`, which the
/// store bumps on every edit/import — an updated source naturally maps to a
/// fresh session, no explicit invalidation hooks needed.
